Make a question for asking the user to convert a decimal number to binary
- Generate a random decimal number
- Check the user's input
  - If the user types a string, give a message that it is not a valid input.
  - If the user types a number that is not a valid binary number, give a
    message that the number is not a valid binary number
  - If the user types a binary number, make a binary number object with the
    user's input, and convert it to decimal.
      - If the converted number is the same as the number randomly generated,
        the user's answer is correct.
      - If the converted number is not the same as the number randomly
        generated, the user's answer is incorrect.
